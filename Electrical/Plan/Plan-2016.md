### What we did right
- Generator
- 4x solar and deep-cycle batteries
- charging station
- PA/DJ equipment

### What we did wrong
- Insufficient safety lights
    - contruction bottleneck and deployment problem
- Insufficient area floods
    - was under-planned, under-specified
- Insufficient theme lighting
- No automatic lights (ambient sensor or time)
- Un-planned, organic trunk (high-power) wiring
    - did not pick up this responsibility and plan it after Mark left
- No signage
    - missing requirement
